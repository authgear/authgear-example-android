# Authgear sample for Android

This repo demonstrates how to add authentication to an Android app using Authgear.

## Project setup

### Create Free Authgear Account
1. Goto [https://portal.authgear.com](https://portal.authgear.com) and create a free account (or login to your existing account).

2. Then navigate to Applications and create a new client application of type Native App.

### Import project to Android Studio
Clone this repo and import to Android Studio, Sync Gradle

### Configuration

The project needs to be configured with your Authgear client application's **Endpoint** and **Client ID** in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, open `app/src/main/java/com/example/authgeardemo/Constants.kt`, and replace `"<AUTHGEAR_CLIENT_ID>"`, `"<AUTHGEAR_ENDPOINT>"` with with your own Authgear client application credentials.

To run this example app, add the following URI to your Authgear client application's Authorized Redirect URI:

- `com.example.authgeardemo://host/path`

See the full tutorial for this demo app [Here](https://docs.authgear.com/get-started/native-mobile-app/android).
